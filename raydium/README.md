# Scripts for gathering data from Raydium

These scripts connect to a Solana node.  I used Chainstack for my testing.  To run these scripts, you'll have to [sign up](https://chainstack.com/pricing/) for a Chainstack account, 
and place your API key in the file `api_key.'

* [get_token_names.py](get_token_names.py) Reads transactions from 'data/raydiumTxsProcessed.csv,' gets a list of all tokens traded checks [data/tokens.csv](data/tokens.csv) to see which token symbols are known for tokens without known symbols, it calls get_symbol (from [token_utils.py](token_utils.py) to add the symbol.
* [get_transactions.py](get_transactions.py) Gets all transactions related to the [Raydium AMM](https://solscan.io/account/675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8).  It writes the Tx signatures as a list (one per line) to [data/raydiumSigs.csv](data/raydiumSigs.csv).  It then gets the transaction details for each of these transactions, 
    and writes the data to [data/raydiumTxs.csv](https://upenn.box.com/s/5tstk731l4oxw9rdo977e6ihmzi9aejb).
* [process_raydium_txs.py](process_raydium_txs.py) Takes the transactions from [data/raydiumTxs.csv](https://upenn.box.com/s/5tstk731l4oxw9rdo977e6ihmzi9aejb) and parses them and writes them to [data/raydiumTxsProcessed.csv](data/raydiumTxsProcessed).
* [token_utils.py](token_utils.py) Provides functions for reading token metadata (e.g, name, symbol, or metadata from NFTs).  Adapted from [solana_metadata_assets_from_wallet.py](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/CrackerHax/61882cf814cde4d9cbc6f5a709e51c34/raw/38d0f11f6f394f7aea0be788f1760f5302b59c91/solana_metadata_assets_from_wallet.py).

# Data

The data generated by [process_raydium_txs.py](process_raydium_txs.py) is too large for github, so the output is stored on Box, and 
can be downloaded at [raydiumTxs.csv](https://upenn.box.com/s/5tstk731l4oxw9rdo977e6ihmzi9aejb)
