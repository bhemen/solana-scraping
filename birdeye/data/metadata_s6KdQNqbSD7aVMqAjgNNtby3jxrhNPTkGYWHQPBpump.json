    "description": "Same idea as when you were in elementary learning division but weren't allowed to just use a calculator even though its infront of you and easier. You need to know the fundamentals/basics first. Then when you got older you were taught how to properly use a calculator and probably encouraged to. I really wouldn't be surprised if I see an 'ai 101' sort of class in the near future for students\r\n\r\n",
