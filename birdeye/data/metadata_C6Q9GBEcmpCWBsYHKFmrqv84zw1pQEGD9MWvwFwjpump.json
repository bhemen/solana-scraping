    "description": "Teacher.Live\r\nTeacher.Live (TCLV) Hello, how are you? My name is Ian, I'm a musician and I love what I do, too bad the world doesn't value this art so much. I am a music teacher and I have a social project in which I teach for free in churches to all the people in my community. Even without support, I do what I can to bring music to children, so that they can change their lives and move away from evil, and I also have the Angolan Community, which my friend (Ale) works and is a Missionary and provides help to the entire Angolan community, and Angolan children, My friend told me that the crypto community would embrace my project, I don't understand much of this, but he gave me 0.45 Sol and told me to tell my story by creating this token, and I would see the magic happen with my eyes. The money raised will help me to be able to maintain this social project of mine and my friend (ale) in angola and save lives, as they saved mine, Video below of My friend (ale) in Angola, on my twitter profile _________________________https://x.com/i/status/1879160560241226110 _________________________PLEASE!
