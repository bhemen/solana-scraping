    "description": "Punk Pavel Durov got arrested. Why? Because he built a P2P social media app where people could exchange words without the worry of surveillance. \r\n\r\nHe gave the power back to the people, creating an encrypted communication channel for them. \r\n\r\nThe usage of such tools could be subjective, but it\u2019s mainly for the greater good of user privacy, which is more important than anything else in this world. \r\n\r\nArresting him in the name of providing a platform to bad actors is a stupid argument. It's akin to arresting Vitalik for building Ethereum because any scammer can launch a memecoin on it and scam people. \r\n\r\nSuch stupid arguments completely dodge the major benefits, so people always get the bad side. We should not keep quiet now\u2014start the protest, make a daily trend of #FREEDUROV, and raise funds for him like we all did for Assange in the past. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fight between crypto and evil governments, and you need to choose the crypto side as it promises a long-term better future."
